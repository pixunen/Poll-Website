# EPOLL BY OTTO PISKONEN
This is the epoll application for Profit Software Junior Software Developer position.

## USAGE
To run the application use
```
dotnet watch run
```

## PROPERTIES
The Back-end part has Controllers and Models folders and the Front-end files are all inside wwwroot folder. I used .NET EF CORE to implement the REST API back-end. For the front-end I made simple javascript/html/css webpage that called my backend with functions.

The whole project took me around 20 hours. I wasn't that familiar with rest api's so I had to do research on the topic before starting. My javascript skills were also a bit rusty so that took time as well.
